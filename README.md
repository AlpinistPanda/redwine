# redwine
In this project a sample set of red wines are analyzed for 12 different 
variables. I selected red wines as a study since I am curious in learning
what makes of a good wine. We will first start with summarizing the data
and identifying every parameter. In a data study it is important to make a
background study to understand the phenomena.
